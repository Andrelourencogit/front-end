    <p>his video is part of a large series introducing HTML & CSS

    <p>In this video, I take a a look at what's happening when we float 
    something with CSS, and how clears work with floats. This video doesn't 
    look at how to use them to build a layout, but instead it looks at understanding
     how they work, so when you do build your layout you'll have a better idea of how 
     to control things.</p>
