                In this video I write the markup (or HTML) for a very common 
                website, with a header, main content area and a sidebar, plus
                 a footer. If you're jus learning how to write HTML and CSS, 
                 and you have any issues with things like floats and clears, 
                 or are curious how other people approach things, this video 
                 is for you!
